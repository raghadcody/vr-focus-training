# VR Focus Training

A Graduation Project focused on 3D Design and VR Integration in Unity to enhance focus and working memory in younger children (6-11) with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

 1. Project Overview

This is a thesis-level design and integration prototype providing a safe, immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience tailored for children aged 6 to 11 years old. The primary goal is to address common challenges in this age group—namely, improving sustained attention, cognitive focus, and memory retention through highly engaging, gamified activities in a distraction-free virtual environment.

Our primary contribution is the creation of the complete VR environment, interactive menus, and the full suite of 3D assets and animations for a set of specific cognitive games. The scope is concentrated on the design and integration aspects using Unity and Blender, without programming the full system logic.

 2. Objectives & Technical Scope

Our key objectives for this younger target audience focus on simplicity, engagement, and safety:

VR Environment Design: Create a vibrant, low-clutter, and intuitive 3D environment optimized for young children and minimal VR discomfort.
Cognitive Asset Creation: Design and model simple, brightly colored, and robust 3D assets for all interactive game elements using Blender.
UX/UI Simplicity: Implement clear, gaze- or simplified controller-driven interaction suitable for early VR users.
Safety Adherence: Ensure strict adherence to safety guidelines, with sessions limited to 5–10 minutes to prevent fatigue and motion sickness.

 3. Cognitive Gamification Module

The prototype features a modular approach using familiar, skill-building game concepts. We have developed the complete 3D models and scene preparation for three activities, **one of which will be selected for full prototype implementation:**

Connect4 | Strategic Planning & Visual Tracking | Large, simple 3D game pieces with clear visual feedback upon placement. 
Difference Between Two Images | Sustained & Selective Attention | Bold, easily distinguishable differences in simplified 3D scenes. 
Puzzle Game | Spatial Reasoning & Problem-Solving | Large, easily manipulated 3D interlocking pieces that offer immediate haptic/visual feedback.

 4. Tools & Technologies

Unity: Primary VR Development Engine, Scene Assembly, and Interaction Integration. 
Blender: High-fidelity 3D Modeling, Texturing, Rigging, and Animation of all custom assets.

 5. Expected Deliverables

VR Prototype Scene: The fully integrated Unity scene, including the main menu and implemented game (assets and interaction setup).
3D Asset Library: All custom Blender models (.blend files, FBX exports) for the environment, characters, and the three game options.
Technical Documentation: Detailed report on 3D/VR design methodology, focusing on child-specific usability and safety guidelines.
