# My Super Morning VR 🌟

**A Therapeutic Daily Routine Trainer for Kids with ADHD**

---

## Project Overview

**Problem:**  
Children with ADHD often face challenges with executive functions such as planning, sequencing, inhibition control, sustained attention, organization, and self-regulation. These difficulties impact daily living activities, including morning routines like waking up, personal hygiene, eating, cleaning, and staying focused.

**Solution:**  
**My Super Morning VR** is an immersive Virtual Reality system designed for clinics, therapists, schools, and parents. It guides children step-by-step through realistic morning routines:

- Waking up & making the bed  
- Brushing teeth  
- Dressing & packing their backpack  
- Eating breakfast  
- Washing dishes & sorting trash  
- Managing unexpected challenges (e.g., cleaning after a pet)  

The VR experience provides structured practice, adaptive prompts, multimodal feedback, difficulty regulation, and a reward system using praise and stars. Each activity intentionally trains different executive functions.

**Unique Value Proposition:**

- Scientifically validated ADHD-centered VR experience  
- Teaches independent real-life skills through guided repetition  
- Includes “Catch the Comet,” a measurable focus-training mini-game  
- Aligns with UDL, ISTE, WCAG/508, pediatric OT, and ADHD clinical guidelines  
- Clinic-ready: logs performance, errors, progress, attention levels, and distractions

**Main Screens / Interfaces:**

1. **Start Room (Bedroom)**  
   - Begin routine, wake up, checklist, simple UI prompts  

2. **Bathroom Interface**  
   - Toothbrush interaction, water tap indicators, door-close reminder  

3. **Kitchen Interface**  
   - Eating with spoon, dishwashing with “Cold vs Hot” tap, trash sorting UI  

4. **Pet Event Screen**  
   - Pet mess appears → emotional regulation moment  
   - Mom gives praise or guidance  

5. **Focus Room (Catch the Comet)**  
   - Simple dark room, bright comet moving slowly  
   - Distraction characters on the sides  
   - Gaze-based tracking + focus meter  

6. **Session Summary UI**  
   - Time taken  
   - Errors & corrections  
   - Assistance requests  
   - Comet focus %  
   - Distraction count  

**Wireframe Goal:**  
Simple, low-distraction UI built according to WCAG 2.1 AA, color-safe, readable, predictable, and child-friendly.
